## Branch Overview

### 1. **Main**

- Production-ready branch containing the stable version of the application.
- **Direct pushes are prohibited.** All changes must be merged via Pull Requests (PRs) from `staging`.

### 2. **Develop**

- Active development branch where new features and bug fixes are implemented.
- Developers create feature or bugfix branches from `develop` and merge them back after completing their work.

### 3. **Staging**

- A pre-production branch for integration testing and QA.
- Aggregates changes from `develop` and prepares them for deployment to `main`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (latest LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (default package manager)
- **Git** (for version control)
- A code editor, preferably **VS Code**

### Environment Variables

Create an `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.ezyrent.com/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Optional Features
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_optional

# Development Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAGGING=true
```

**Important**:

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control.
- Use secure storage for environment secrets.

### Steps to Set Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EzyRentOrg/ezyrent-web.git
   cd ezyrent-web
   ```

2. **Checkout the Appropriate Branch**:

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:

## Workflow Guidelines

### Feature Development

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Description of changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a PR to `develop`.

4. After PR is approved and merged
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name   # Deletes local branch
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name  # Deletes remote branch
   ```
5. After testing, merge `develop` into `staging` and subsequently into `main`.
